/*what are data types 
we need a variable  to store a value that value could be of any type string ,number,boolean etc. so the type of that value is known as datatype
//***ABOUT STRING***
A string is a datatype and it is a series of character which is inside quotes. 
In Js we have three way to define string
1.In Doubles quotes
2.In single quotes
3.inside backticks   

the first one and second works same but  in backticks there is  a additional feature that we can use variable and expression inside the string with the help of ${..}
String could be of any length zero empty or many.


#####  NUMBERS#####
The number is also a data type which contain both integer and floating point number.
we can perform many operation like multiplication,addition,substraction division.
In number Datatype there is also a "special numeric value " like infinity and NaN(not a number)

if we devide any number with 0 it will give us infinity.and if we devide any number with a string it will give us NaN. 

***** BIGINT DATATYPE****
IN JS number datatype  cannot represent number larger that (2 raise to power 53 -1    or smaller than -(2 raise to poewr 53-1))

we created a bigint type number by appending n to the end of the integer
