####if Statement####

The if statement is used when we need to evaluate a condition in parantheses. If the result is true the block of  code is executed .

The if statement evaluates the expression in paranthesis  and convert the result to boolean.

A number 0, empty string "" , null,undefined , NaN all become false.
other value become true

The if statement also contain a else clause. It execute when our if condition is false.

Now if we have varient of condition we use elseif we can use elseif as many time but it should be between if and else.

The else is optional.

######CONDITIONAL OPERATOR####
 The conditional operator is also used to check the condition. It is denoted by "?" 
 It is shorter and simple way to write condition.
 Conditional operator is also called ternary operator .
 we can write the condition with or without the parantheses but with parantheses code looks more readable.
