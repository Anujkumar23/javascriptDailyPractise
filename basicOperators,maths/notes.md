/*   What is Operand
when we apply a mathematical operation on the value, the value is known as operand ,like in multiplication 5*2 then 5 and 2 is is operand and * is operator.


what is unary operator
When a operator is applied on single operand that is called unary operator 

####What is Binary operator
when a operator is applied on two operands that  is called binary operator

when a unary operator is applied on a number it does not do anything but if it the operand is not a number it convert it into a  number.

#####STRING CONCATENATION WITH BINARY+
As we know that +operator is used to add two number what if + is applied in strings  it concatenate them
If any of the operand is string,then the other is converted to string.

Operators works one after the another if we have 3 operands and first two are number and third one is string then it add first two number and then concate the third one.

####NUMERIC CONVERSION####
when a unary operator is applied on a number it does not do anything but if it the operand is not a number it convert it into a  number
unary Operator work same as the Number()global method do.

###Assignment = is also an operator and return a value
assignment Operator has lowest precedence 2.
thats why all the calculation is done and then assign value tothe variable.

#### INCREMENT/DECREMENT 
Increment and decrement can be applied to variable only if we try to use it on a vlaue like 5++ give us result.
++variable is called prefix   increment
variable++ is calles postfix increment
both of these statment increase the variable value by 1.
