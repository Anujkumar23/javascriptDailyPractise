# Function
Function is a block of code design to perform a particular task.
Once we define the function we can call it multiple times without repetition.
In javascript we define a function with function keyword then the name of the function and we can also give the parameter inside the parantheses.And then code of the function inside the curly braces.
The function will execute only  when we call the function by its name.

# Local Variable
A variable declare inside a function is access only inside the function.

# Outer Variable
Outer variable can access  inside the function.
The function can modify the outer variable inside the function.

# shadowig
If the same named variable is declared inside the function then it is called shadowing.

# Global Variable
Variable declared outside of  any  function  is known as Global function.
Global variable can be access inside the function if their is no local variable of same name

# Parameters
A parameters are the variable which is passed inside the parantheses when we define the function.

# Argument
Argument are the value that  is passed to the function when it is called.

# Default value
When we call a function and argument is not given then the value become undefined.

# Returning a value
A function can return a value back into the code as a result.
