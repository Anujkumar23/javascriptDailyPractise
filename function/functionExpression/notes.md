# Function Expression
Function expression is another way to create a function .
With this  we can create a new function in the middle of any expression.
When we create a function expression their is no name after function keyword.
So in function expression we create a function and assign it to a variable.
In JS function is a value.We can copy ,assign or declared in any place of the code.
We can copy a function to another variable.
In function expression when the execution flow passes to the right side of assignment then only we can use it as a function.
If we call function expression before the execution reaches it, it will give us error.


# Callback Function
A function as as argument in another function is known as callback function .We can call back this function lately 

# Arrow Function
Arrow function is another way of creating a function.its syntax is shorter and better then function Expression.
it takes the argument inside the parantheses but if there is only one argument we can omit parantheses
If there is no argument and the parantheses is empty,the parantheses must be there.
