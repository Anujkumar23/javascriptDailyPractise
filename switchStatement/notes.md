# Switch Statement
We use switch statement when we want to replace the multiple if .
The switch Statement  can has multiple case and a default .
The switch statement take a value inside the parantheses and that value will check with the value of first case ,second case and so on.
If the equality is found the switch statement start  execute the code inside that case until it found the break .
If no case match with the value of switch statement the default value will execute.
If we dont put any break after the case then, when the equality matches all cases will execute without checking the values.
We can also group the cases if we want the same message   in the cases.
In switch statement the  value is checked by strict equality so the both type and value should be same.
