*****ABOUT VAR******

The var is used  to declare a variabale. It is the old method to declare a variable.
var  has a global scope and we can redeclare and reassign value in var.
It works differently in global scope/function scope and block scope.
So in global scope we can access value of variable in our program anywhere
And in function it has a function scope so we can access value inside the function only .
The var does not follow the block scope and we can access value from the code inside the block scope

****ABOUT LET****
The let is also used to declare a variable is is a new keyword to declare a variable
In let we cannot redeclare a variable in same scope

let allow to declare variable  in global scope and function scope and Block scope.

So in global scope we can access variable in global scope.
In block scope we can not access value that outside this code block because it work locally If we try to access value outside its scope give us error.
Same happen in case of function scope values can access only in function scope itself.If we try to access value outside its scope give us error.


*****ABOUT CONST****
const is another way to declare  a variable and we cannot declare it without initiallization.
We only declare a const variable when we know that we will not change this value in future.
Also we cannot initialize it in another line unlike happen in var and let.
 In const we cannot redeclare a variable add reassign it in same scope.
 In block scope we can access value from global environment and value inside block scope work locally we cannot access it outside the block scope.
 In function scope the value canbe access only in function we cannot access value outside function block.

 Sometime we write our constant value in Uppercase.There are some value that are difficult to remember and their value never gonna be change in future so uppercase constant are used to store hard coded value.
 We can also write the constant in uppercase when we know the value and write it in the code.
