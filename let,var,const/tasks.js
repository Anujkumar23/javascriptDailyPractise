// Working with variable
// ##Declare two variable admin and name.

let admin;
let name;

// ##Assign value "john to name"
 name= "john"

//  ##copy the value from name to admin
admin=name;

// ##show the value of admin using alert
alert(admin)


// ##Giving the right name
// 1.Create a variable with the name of our planet .How would you name such a variable.

let ourPlanet = "earth"

// 2.Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

let currentVisitorName="anuj"

// ###Uppercase const

const bithday ="18.04.1982"
 const age=someCode(bithday)

//  In birthday we know the value of birthday ,and in constant we can write the constant in upperCase when value is known before code execution.
// but in case of age we have no idea  what is the age. We will get the age after code execution.

// So birthday should be in uppercase and age should be in lowercase.So


const BIRTHDAY= "18.04.1982"
const age =somecode(BIRTHDAY);
