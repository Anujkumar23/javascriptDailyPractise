// We can also use strict mode in function only by putting "use strict" in the beginning of the function.

// There is no way to cancel  the  strict mode once we  start using it. 

// ###SHOULD WE USE IT

// otherwise we can use this 

//Using a variable without declaring not allowed
// Using an object without declaring not allowed 
// Deleting a variale or Object is not allowed.
// The this keyword in strict mode works different in function it retrun undefined.

// Reserved words cannot used in strict mode
